    "code": "P1000",

    "meaning": "OBD-II Monitor Testing Not Complete",
    "possible_causes": [
      "This is not a fault code. It means the vehicle's readiness monitors have not completed their self-checks.",
      "The battery was recently disconnected.",
      "The vehicle's computer (PCM) was recently reset or reflashed.",
      "The vehicle has not been driven long enough to complete a full 'drive cycle'."

    "troubleshooting_steps": [
      "1. No repair is needed for this code.",
      "2. To clear the code, the vehicle must be driven through a complete 'Ford Drive Cycle' to allow all monitors to run.",
      "3. This typically includes a mix of city driving (stop-and-go) and highway driving (steady speed).",
      "4. The code will clear itself once all monitors have passed."

    "meaning": "Lack of HO2S11 Switch, Sensor Indicates Lean (Bank 1)",
    "possible_causes": [
      "Faulty upstream oxygen (O2) sensor (Bank 1, Sensor 1)",

      "Clogged fuel injector on Bank 1",

    "troubleshooting_steps": [
      "1. Check for vacuum leaks specific to Bank 1 (intake gaskets, vacuum lines).",
      "2. Monitor the O2 sensor voltage. If it is stuck low (lean), it confirms the code.",
      "3. Test the O2 sensor heater circuit.",
      "4. If no leaks are found, replacing the upstream O2 sensor for Bank 1 is the most common fix."
