      "The heating element inside the Air/Fuel (A/F) sensor has failed.",

      "2. If the fuse is good, use a multimeter to check for 12V power at the sensor's connector (with the key on).",
      "3. Check the resistance of the heater element itself at the sensor's pins. If it's 'open loop' (OL) or out of spec, the sensor is bad.",
      "4. The most common fix is to replace the A/F Sensor (Bank 1, Sensor 1)."

      "1. This is a complex code. First, check all other codes.",
